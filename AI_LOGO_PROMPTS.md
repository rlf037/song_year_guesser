## Tips for Using These Prompts:

### For DALL-E (ChatGPT):
- Use Prompt 1 or 5
- Add: "Generate in PNG format, 1024x1024 resolution"

### For Midjourney:
- Use any prompt + add parameters: `--ar 1:1 --style raw --v 6`
- For cleaner results add: `--no shadows, no 3D, no gradients`

### For Stable Diffusion:
- Use Prompt 2 or 4
- Negative prompts: "gradient, shadow, 3D, cartoon, busy, cluttered, colorful"
- Sampling steps: 30-50

### Refinement Tips:
- If too complex: add "extremely minimalist, simple"
- If too colorful: add "monochromatic with single accent color"
- If not professional enough: add "corporate identity, Fortune 500 style"
- For variations: change "hexagon" to "circle" or "square with rounded corners"
